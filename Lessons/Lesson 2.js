// You can declare a variable using any one of the three keywords: "var", "let" and "const"
var boolean = true;
let string = "Hello world!";
const pi = 3.14159;

// You can access a variable's value using its name
console.log(boolean);
console.log(string);
console.log(pi);

// You can assign a new value to a variable
boolean = false;
string = "The quick brown fox.";

console.log(boolean); // -> false
console.log(string);  // -> "The quick brown fox"

// Write your own local variable here called name and make its value a string with your name in it
let name = "Myra"
let food = "Lazania"
console.log(name);
console.log(food);
// (Make sure you use the right keyword!)
// If you get stuck, scroll down for a hint.


// Try making some more variables below and print them to the console












































































// Here's a hint if you're stuck:
// Local variables are declared with "let" or "const", you can use either. Here's an example with my name:
/*
let name = "Matthew";
const name = "Matthew";
