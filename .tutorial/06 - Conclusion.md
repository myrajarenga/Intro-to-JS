# Conclusion

Well, that's it!
You now know the basics of JavaScript!
You can do some pretty cool stuff, however there's plenty more to learn.
Want to learn more?
With any luck, I'll be making more tutorials which are a little more advanced.
I'm planning on making a simple web game development with JavaScript tutorial next!
