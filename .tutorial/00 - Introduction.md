# Introduction

Hi, welcome to my JavaScript tutorial!

Throughout this tutorial you will learn the basics of JavaScript, an essential programming language for web development (many parts of this _somewhat_ interactive tutorial are actually made with JavaScript!).

In this tutorial, we'll look at data types, variables, logic, loops and functions.
If you ever want to learn more, two great places to start your search are [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (very technical in depth documentation with examples for everything) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp) (beginner friendly documentation with easy to understand examples that will help your understanding).

If you're ever stuck or confused, feel free to ask questions [here](https://replit.com/@MattDESTROYER/Intro-to-JS?v=1)!

By the way, if you enjoy this tutorial and want to support me and this tutorial, you can tip me with cycles [here](https://replit.com/@MattDESTROYER/Intro-to-JS?v=1) (Thanks to [@triptych](https://replit.com/@triptych), the first person to tip this tutorial.) or you can support me directly [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mattdestroyer)!
